# advent-of-code
Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge hosted at adventofcode.com. From December 1st to 25th, a daily challenge consisting of two parts is published. Older editions are also still available. 

This repository contains my Python solutions - of various degrees of optimizations - for Advent of Code. Its contents are the result of a self-directed learning process, as well as experimentation. Code inside is a mix of the two and not representative of what I consider "proper" code.
