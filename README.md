# advent-of-code
Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual coding challenge hosted at [adventofcode.com](https://www.adventofcode.com). From December 1st to 25th, a daily puzzle consisting of two parts is published. Past editions are still available on their website. 

This repository contains my Python solutions for AoC. Its contents are the result of a self-directed learning process, as well as experimentation. Code inside is a mix of the two and not representative of what I consider "proper" code: these are scripts to solve one-off problems and therefore see no reuse, so I've focused on solving the puzzles rather than writing clean modules or a standardized codebase. 

The puzzle descriptions and inputs can be found at [AoC's website](https://adventofcode.com/2019/events). They are not included in this repository given [the creator's comments about this practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e4mkjq/allowed_to_use_problem_text_as_github_readme/).
